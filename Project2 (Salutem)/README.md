## Salutem

_Salutem_ is a tool designed to help users become better informed about any health-related issues they might have. Users can create an account, select the appropriate symptoms and receive a diagnosis based on the possible diseases or issues they might have. Additionally, it provides the user with the most applicable medical professional specialization, saving them time and money. _Salutem_ is not intended to replace a visit to a doctor but to help them learn more about their personal health.

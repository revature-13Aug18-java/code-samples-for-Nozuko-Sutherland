# Salutem

Salutem is a tool, designed to help users become better informed about any health-related issues they might have. Users can create an account, select the appropriate symptoms and receive a diagnosis based on the possible diseases or issues they might have. Additionally, it provides the user with the most applicable medical professional specialization, saving them time and money. It is not intended to replace a visit to a doctor but to help them learn more about their personal health.
